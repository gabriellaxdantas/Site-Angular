    "description": "Eight years ago Gotham City was titled ''America's worst city, next to Detroit''. And with good reason. The crime rate was off the charts, and according to the Gotham City Police Department, Gotham was within the top ten most dangerous cities in America. The Wayne Foundation is a charity organization run by Wayne Enterprises in Gotham City. The foundation is known for its various charity campaigns to help the needy . The Wayne Foundation has been a source of hope for the city, which was once considered one of the most dangerous cities in America with high crime rates . Since then, the city has worked to improve it's situation and the Wayne Foundation has been one of the main contributors to this change ."

    "description": "The bitter struggle in the Gotham City District Attorney race ended yesterday with a landslide win for Harvey Dent. With 97% of precincts reporting, Dent won the election with just over 70% of the vote, followed by Roger Garcetti at 16% and Dana Worthington at 14%. Exit polls showed fear of violent crime and desire for change fueled Dent's decisive victory. ''It's one of those 'only in Gotham' stories,'' said longtime political observer Walt DeFabrizio. ''Our city has a way of finding the leaders it needs at every critical moment. And obviously, the voters felt we needed a hard-charging, unbending prosecutor like Harvey Dent. Dent vowed to take quick action against the crime bosses and corrupt officials he claims are destroying the city''. 'Gotham is sick and tired of rising crime rates and endemic corruption, and I will target our city's enemies in my first day in office,'' Dent said."

    "description": "On the day of Harvey Dent's landslide victory, Batman upstaged the new district attorney with a dramatic election-day intervention and the narrow defeat of the 'Save Batman' Proposition D on the ballot. Amid widespread reports of voter intimidation at Gotham polling sites, Batman saved a Dent supporter at East City Park from three club-wielding men. The incident helped dramatize the Gotham proposition that voters nixed, which would have required GPD to make arresting vigilantes its ''lowest priority.''"

    "description": "Furthering its inroads into civilian and military uses for wireless technology, Wayne Enterprises announced an $80 million investment deal with cellphone giant Nokia today. Sources inside Wayne Enterprises report that CEO Lucius Fox is taking direct control of the company's mounting wireless research and development activity. ''This is a fantastic deal for both Wayne Enterprises and Nokia,'' said wireless tech expert Jay Capon-Multey. ''For Wayne Enterprises, it provides access to Nokia's wealth of bleeding-edge research into multiple uses of high-frequency cell-phone signals. And Nokia wins by deepening its relationship with Wayne Enterprises which has extensive global reach on every continent.'' For years, Nokia has been cultivating technology partners to increase its lead in GPS, laser, and optical location technologies."
